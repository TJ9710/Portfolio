        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>When I was in middle school, I had a computer class that taught me stuff I could do on the computer and the career option we could take. I remember every wednesday, My teacher would take us to the computer lab so we could practice our typing. He even taught us the introduction to front end Web Development. It was the only class I really enjoy back when I was in school. My Dad and his family were big on technology.
